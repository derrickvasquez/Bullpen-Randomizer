# Bullpen-Randomizer

## Live Demo https://derrickvasquez.github.io/Bullpen-Randomizer/target=_blank


This is a tool designed to be used during bullpen sessions. The goal is to simulate the different outcomes of an actual baseball game, and to make practices a bit more competitive. 

After each strike is thrown, select the appropriate button to receive a random outcome. 

## How to Use

Pitcher throws a strike and has a chance of the following outcomes:
<br />
<br />
'Batter did not swing',
<br />
'Batter swung and miss',
<br />
'Batter grounded out',
<br />
'Batter flew out',
<br />
'Batter hit a foul ball',
<br />
'Batter hit a SINGLE',
<br />
'Batter hit a DOUBLE',
<br />
'Batter hit a TRIPLE',
<br />
'Batter hit a HOMERUN',
<br />
'Error in field'

The second strike a pitcher throws generates a random chance of the previously stated outcomes.

The third strike thrown includes:
<br />
'Batter struck out looking',
<br />
'Batter struck out swinging'
